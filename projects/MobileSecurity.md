## INTRODUCTION
Mobile application development is one of the fields with the fastest growth rates—faster than web development, according to Barua et al. Nevertheless, studies that look at the security issues that developers confront do not focus on mobile platforms. Since Android and iPhone development account for 71% and 28% of the market share [25], respectively, they will be the main topics of our study. Without the billions of lines of code that support this digital environment, we could not have imagined a connected world where millions of people use mobile devices for banking, shopping, staying connected, and self-education. In this complex programming structure, it is very difficult to avoid opening gaps in the code, paving the way for vulnerability. With the number of cyber-attacks increasing, it is more important than ever to focus on mobile app security standards. Mobile application developers must identify all security vulnerabilities and verify that the application is free from malware and virus attacks.
To accomplish this, developers frequently turn to question-and-answer websites like Stack Overflow to get as- sistance from their peers regarding the technical difficulties they encounter. In this project, we propose examining the postings’ content to identify the main subjects of developer debate, their trends, and the relationships between them. Understanding these topics could be helpful to a wide range of people, including educators (who could use the results as a guide for what to cover when teaching students how to develop mobile applications securely), security researchers (who could use our replication package and the discussion topics results as representations of real-world mobile security issues), and developers of all levels (for the development of better automated security vulnerability detection tools). Additionally, users can utilize our method to find posts with related material so they can read every question and response that pertains to their problem.
Previous research subjects have covered challenges with mobile development [15], refactoring trends and topics [9], and the typical security questions developers ask [27]. Similar techniques were employed in all of them, which included mining Stack Overflow posts to produce a data set; topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a well-liked statistical model for searching and grouping data to identify trends and topics [2], [9]; carrying out various statistical analyses on the dataset; and establishing the context of Stack Overflow discussion topics discovered using LDA to generate topic clusters for further analysis.
