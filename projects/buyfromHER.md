summary: The development of an app prototype to strengthen the local economy, with emphasis on female entrepreneurship.  
---

### Key Concepts
The project aims at businesswomen and seeks to promote their products and services, facilitating access and visibility to customers.
Since digital platforms are on the rise, an application can reach a large percentage of the population and encourage its users to buy
from local female entrepreneurs. It is believed that the project can contribute more broadly, as it creates a platform that
facilitates the discovery of desired products and services without the need to travel long distances.

### Motivation
The motivation of this project is to promote the individual development of women, strengthen and diversify the local economy, generate more jobs,
and improve the income distribution in the neighborhood/region. 

### Methodology
This project was carried out using the Top-Down approach to achieve its goals and objectives, while it also includes conducting research and gathering information to understand the needs of users to get the first ideas (insights).

### Differential Requirements 
- Seller has the option to not accept returns, as long as the seller informs this return policy prior to purchase.
- Incentivize to buy locally by providing the exact distance from buyers to stores.
- Prioritize business with higher customer reviews and quality products over popularity only.
- All the stores must pass though a process of verification and authentication of the products/services to avoid possible scams.
