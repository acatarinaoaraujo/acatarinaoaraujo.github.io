It goes without saying that we all need to be aware of the weather. Weather apps and apps for smartphones have advanced considerably over time, and today's versions are the best ever.Â 

Klimato 4 is a very precise weather tool you'll ever need to navigate any weather situation, including snowstorms, strong winds, sun, and rain. The app provides information about the weather for the next 4 days, and for each day, it gives the weather forecast on 4 different hours of the day.

The forecast has data about the population, coordinates, weather, and temperature of the location. This was made possible by using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5), where the forecast is available in JSON and XML format. 

### What I Have Learned
By working on this project I was able to learn how to use UIStackView, NSLayoutConstraint, UISwitch, UIScrollView, [Delegation](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/delegation-in-swift/),
  [CLLocationManager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager), perform a URL request, and parse JSON by using JSONDecoder.
