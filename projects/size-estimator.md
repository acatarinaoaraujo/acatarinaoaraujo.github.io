### What I Learned

- **UIStoryboardSegue**: It specifies the flow of the program. In the storyboard file for a program, a segue describes the transition between two view controllers by clicking on a button, table row, or other controls linked to the segue. 
- **UISegmentedControl**: If you want to give users choices that influence the same object, state, or view, use a segmented control. A segmented control often has segments of equal width. Segments can have text or graphics, just like buttons.

- **UI Sliders**: By using UI Sliders you need to indicate the range of values that the slider encompasses configure the slider's appearance if desired by setting appropriate colors, and connect the slider to one or more action methods.
