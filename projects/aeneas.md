summary: Application to aid a mobile clinic to keep track of their medical supplies, and medications.
---

## Objective

The goal of Aeneas Medical is to create an application to aid a mobile clinic to keep track of its medications
and supplies, and have access to patients' health information.
 
## Background of the Clinic 

They are a mobile clinic that sees anywhere from 2-10 patients per half-day at various sites around the island.
Sites are variable – brick and mortar, within shelters, outdoors with pop-up tents, or in the field with backpacks
There are anywhere from 4 to 15-20 learners in clinic in any given half-day and all use our EHR, ”Athena” to document
information about patient care.
