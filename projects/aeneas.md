### Overview

Aeneas Medical is focused on developing a specialized application that assists mobile clinics in effectively managing their medication inventory, supplies, and patient health information. This technology aims to streamline operations and improve accessibility to healthcare services.

The Hawaii H.O.M.E. Project was established in 2005 with the objective of enhancing healthcare quality and access for individuals experiencing homelessness in Hawaii. Through student-run free clinics held at various locations across Oahu, the project provides free medical services to both sheltered and unsheltered individuals. Additionally, the project utilizes a mobile health van to reach out to unsheltered populations and organizes special events for children in shelters, with the goal of increasing awareness and understanding of the healthcare needs of the homeless community.
