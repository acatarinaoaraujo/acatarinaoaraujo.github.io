### Overview:

The Hawaii Department of Education plays a vital role in advancing student achievement and maintaining educational excellence with a focus on equal access. To streamline legislative initiatives, the department currently relies on the IBM Lotus Notes system. Our application, DOE Legislative Tracker (DOELT), aims to modernize and enhance the outdated tracking system.

### How Does It Work
To ensure real-time accuracy, DOELT utilizes a custom data scraper API that retrieves information directly from the Hawaii State Legislature site. The scraper API consists of three scrapers, gathering data from the "Advanced Reporting," individual bill/measure pages, and "Upcoming Hearings" sections. Through the "All Bills" page, users can access and save specific bills into the DOE's database. The "DOE Bills" page allows users to view, edit, and create detailed testimonies for the saved bills. The system tracks testimony statuses on the homepage and enables users to download testimonies as PDF files. Additionally, the "Calendar" page displays upcoming hearing information, enabling users to stay informed about important events.

### Whatâ€™s Next for DOELT - DOE Legislative Tracker
Moving forward, our focus will be on implementing a multi-level administrative authority system that grants different levels of access to application features based on users' positions or offices. Furthermore, we aim to develop a robust management plan that encompasses both the system itself and user management. Specifically, we will enhance the administrator's capabilities by allowing them to add new user accounts, modify user roles as necessary, and delete accounts when users are no longer employed. Additionally, we will work on improving the homepage dashboard to provide users with a personalized experience tailored to their specific roles.
