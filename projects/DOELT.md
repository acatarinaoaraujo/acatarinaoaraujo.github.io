summary: A modern legislative tracker app that helps Hawai'i's Department of Education keep up with upcoming hearings and write testimonies more efficiently through custom built scrapers.
---

DOELT is a modern legislative tracking system that is designed to replace the DOE's current legislative tracker. DOELT integrates a modern user interface that enhances the system's accessibility and usability. It uses a custom data scraper API to ensure that its information always reflects the latest information from the state capitol. The scraper API gets information directly from the Hawaii State Legislature site in realtime and consists of three different scrapers. The first scraper gets information from the “Advanced Reporting” page, which consists of all of the bills and measures for a given year. The second scraper obtains more detailed information from individual bill/measure pages. Finally, the third scraper retrieves important events and links from the “Upcoming Hearings” page.
