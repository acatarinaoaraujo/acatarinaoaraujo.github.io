### Semantic UI
There are many advantages in using it instead of just raw HTML and CSS. So far, I have found it to be helpful and fairly easy to learn and apply. It could be stressful if you are trying to learn everything at once as there are many possible usages. In this case, I think it is best to study a little every day to reinforce what you have learned through practice.

By using the Semantic UI, it is possible to create modern layouts. The use of the framework provides a variety of components, full of features such as adding a “centered” container, columns or rows, and icons that can be formatted with different sizes and colors. It is not possible to have the same result using only HTML and CSS in such a short time. Even though we would still be able to create websites, they would not look as modern and sophisticated. Indeed, it would look like a prehistoric website.

Another advantage of Semantic UI is the documentation. It has well-organized documentation and guides on how to start using it, which can be accessed through the link
[here](https://semantic-ui.com/).

### UI Frameworks

Since UI frameworks are widely used, you will have plenty of materials available online, such as tutorials, articles, videos etc.
A quick search and it is possible to easily find the answer, which definitely helps when we are struggling with something. As we
mentioned in the discussion about Semantic UI above, frameworks, in general, provide good online documentation for your reference. 

With the use of a framework, the development time decreases significantly, as you will focus your time more on the development rather
than raw code. The application development process is easier because it is not necessary to write as many lines of code as in the projects
developed from scratch. Projects created from scratch take a longer time than that with the use of a framework to achieve the same 
functionalities. Thus, saving time and effort. For companies saving time, effort and money is important, for this reason, developers who 
know how to use UI frameworks are ahead in the job market compared with developers who do not know.

UI frameworks use natural language, which undoubtedly makes the code more readable and easier to understand. It is unlikely that we will 
get stuck for hours, trying to find the error we made. It is fairly easy to spot mistakes and fix them. Therefore, making the code easy 
to manage and error-free. The only disadvantage I see in using Frameworks all the time is that it can make us too comfortable in such a 
way that we want to solve everything with it. Problems that are sometimes simple to solve without the use of a Framework, we may end up not 
knowing to solve the problem using a raw programming language.

 In short, developing software with the aid of a framework allows it to be faster, more efficient, error-free, and even saves money. A good 
 framework guarantees the quality of the application and makes it possible to finish the project in less time. That is, it is a great option 
 for either a beginning developer or a experienced one who need to complete projects quickly and effectively.
