###  The Beginning

When I started as a freshman at the University of Hawaii, I did not have experience with computers and 
programming languages. The first class I took in the ICS Department was Introduction to Computer Science
(ICS 111). In this class, we used Java and EZ (a Java graphics library). As I start getting more experience
with Java, I noticed the level of difficulty. After Java, I start programming in C and C++ as a part of the
curriculum. If Java at that time was difficult to learn, imagine C or C++. It can all get pretty overwhelming.

I did not know much about JavaScript at that time, but I have read it is the most popular programming
language these days. While Java seems to be losing popularity, JavaScript has been gaining popularity.
JavaScript is everywhere on the internet, there are countless resources to learn about it (such as
freeCodeCamp.org), and the community is very active. My experience with JS has been amazing so far. 
I like how flexible and dynamic the language is. It is possible to return entire functions as a return 
value, something that is not possible in Java.


###  The Advantages of Learning JavaScript

JavaScript creates visual effects with much ease and rapidness than Java and C/C++. The JavaScript language
uses a more human-language syntax, thus making it an easier language to learn and remember. I believe it is
a good way to start for someone who does not have a lot of experience with programming. Any person can learn
it very easily and use it to develop sophisticated websites, programs, and so forth. One of the benefits of 
JavaScript is that it can be run immediately from the browser, which is much simpler. 

JavaScript can also be applied in many different kinds of applications. There are several languages that can 
be used either front-end or back-end of an application, but JavaScript can be used to both, in all layers of 
an application. If a programmer understands the language well, he will be able to write in all layers as well,
becoming a full-stack developer. Overall, JS is a great language that gives the user many new possibilities 
and it deserves recognition.

###  Athletic Software Engineering
 
Regarding the course format and materials of software engineering (ICS 314), I really like to have a 
well-organized website that provides all lectures of the week by the module. The screencasts and readings
are very helpful. I have found the assignments to be entertaining so far. The only thing I do not like 
is the grading of the WODs (Work of the Day). In fact, the WODs themselves are fun, they are not very 
difficult, and the time to complete is fair. I find the WODs to be good practice for the students, and 
it pushes them to practice more. On the other hand, students who are trying hard and making effort to do 
well in the class, might feel frustrated with bad grades and feeling uncapable. Also, since there is no 
partial grading, students who might not have attempted the WOD receive the same grade as students who 
attempted and got wrong. 

It is still early to say if the WODS will work for me. To be honest, I am worry, I have not calculated the impact
it will have on the final grade. But just like everything else in life, we can only do our best. Hopefully, 
participating every week on Brandon's BWOD exercise and understanding very well the practice WODS will help. 
The internet also provides many websites we can learn Javascript, thus there are countless resources to do well.
So far, I have had two WODS, my source code did not work properly, but I was very close. I feel confident things will
be better. 

### Athletic Software Engineering (Update)

I have written about *one Athletic Software Engineering* at the beginning of ICS 314 (as seen above). I was going to edit, but
I decided to leave to show that the opinion of a student can change over the course. I was not a big fan of the WODS, 
but now, at the end of ICS 314, I believe I might have overreacted. I was probably a lit upset that day. Indeed, I have 
failed a few WODS (a few!), and having a 0/100 in your gradebook is at the minimum sad. But things get better! You start 
getting 100/100 - as long as you study for the WODS -, and things are fine. I feel I have learnt a lot more in this way,
as we must be well-prepared for it.
