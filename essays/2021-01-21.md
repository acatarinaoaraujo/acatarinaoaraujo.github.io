Choosing which career to follow is always an important and scary decision, which
requires a lot of attention. The area of technology attracted a lot of attention
from many students, mainly because it is an area that has been gaining importance.
The demand to create new solutions and technological tools in several areas has 
increased greatly. Including games, robotics, and more innovations.

Specifically, the Software Engineering market is one of the fastest-growing, not
only in the United States but also in the world, which generates more possibility
of operating in companies of all sizes, including with opportunities for growth.
This is because technology has taken care of almost all areas of our lives and 
facilitating our needs. As you may have noticed, many people have smartphones, 
computers, and other electronic devices. 

### So why the decision?

In addition to loving this field, you also need knowledge and experience in order
to succeed. I decided to be a part of this because I was always passionate about 
technology, so shifting to this area was the most natural to me. The second reason
is the flexibility that this area can offer. But I believe it is worth mentioning 
that all the decisions I made regarding this career were guided by three basic things:
first, work on your own if you prefer, second, work remotely, third, always learning 
and exercising the mind.

### My plans

When I started, I felt overwhelmed with so many paths I could take in the area of 
technology. I wanted to learn everything about Python, C++, C, Java, PHP, JavaScript,
etc. But now every time I finish one class, my vision starts to narrow a lit bit, and
I feel more inclined towards one side. I want to choose one thing and do my best at it.
We should always have a plan for everything, regardless of how small or simple it is.

My goal at this moment is to study in the most optimized way possible, while I am still
an undergraduate student and at the same time building parallel projects. After that,
I plan on continuing my education with a masterâ€™s degree in the same area. Hopefully,
becoming a software engineer in ten years, with many fascinating projects. It is still 
early to say in what programming languages I am going to focus on, as I still have many
ICS courses to complete. But since the vast majority of development today is focused on the 
web and applications, I have the interest to learn more in depth about HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript.
