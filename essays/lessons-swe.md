In ICS 414 I experienced working with a large number of students willing to learn and improve their skills. 
It taugh me how to work with other people, how to communicate with the group properly, and share ideas for the project we created.
But I did not just learned about web/mobile application development in ICS 414, but also about all of the approaches needed to be effective
in software engineering. Agile Project Management and Testing were two of the most intriguing topics I learnt. Although I learned it before in ICS 314,
it is in ICS 414 that we spent more time working on the project and using those helpful approaches.

#### What is Agile Project Management?
Agile project management is about more than simply speed; it's also about project integration and adaptability. 
It's useful for making last-minute adjustments to the plan, such as shifting priorities, delaying activities if needed,
or altering project features. It is a lightweight solution when compared to traditional project management. 
In other words, the entire project is broken down into smaller chunks to make it easier to make changes without affecting the project's other components.
That's the method we used for our project while also using GitHub to report our progress, requirements, and project ideas. Along the semester we changed our 
ideas while trying to improve the project, and fulfilling the client's request.

#### Why The Traditional Methods Are Less Efficient

In a conventional project management, there is a period of planning prior to the project's implementation.
It's the point at which all of the specs are finalized. The project's qualities cannot be readily adjusted.
Traditional approaches make it possible to deliver a project just once due to the way they are planned.
That is, just one portion of the job is completed at a time, and everything is gathered and submitted in the end.

In agile management, however, only the basics are decided at the beginning, and the project is defined over time, 
in an iterative way, there is an incentive for team collaboration as well. The characteristics of the final project
can be changed, if necessary, at any point in its execution without too much bureaucracy. Agile methods perform several
tasks at the same time, each person focus on an issue. Thus, the small issues can be approved throughout the execution of 
the project, so that everything is in good by the deadline.
