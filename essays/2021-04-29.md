When we are learning to program, it is common to worry only about making the program work, and this is already a very important part. However, with a little bit more of experience, we start to think of other aspects of how we can improve the quality of what we develop. If we are working on a project with more people, for example, how can we make this code more readable, easier to understand, maintain and create our functionalities on top of what already exists? How can we avoid duplicating the code? How to make the code more flexible? Thatâ€™s why we must talk about Design Patterns.

They are not magic formulas that solve problems, they are not ready code that we insert into our applications. Design Patterns are just patterns that offer a concept of a solution to a problem that happens frequently. These patterns were created by experienced developers, who have been experimenting with different solutions over the years. These standards have even influenced programming languages and, like everything in software engineering, are constantly changing.

### Why Should We Consider Design Patterns?

Imagine that you are doing something new for the first time. For example, learning how to make *Tortellini*. You know what result you want to achieve, and you have an idea of how to mix the ingredients for it. However, it would help a lot if you could look a recipe that guides you to reach this result in a way that many people have done before, avoiding problems that you might encounter along the way, such as over-stuff your pasta with filling. This is how it works with design patterns. They are models that have been used, tested, and documented by developers before. 


 When we develop software, it is common to find issues. Automatically, we remember how we solved a similar issue previously. It is almost as if there is a pattern for solving certain types of problems that we encounter. Similarly, Design Patterns focus on reusing solutions. Although all the problems are not the same, if you break them and find similarities with those that have been solved before, it is possible to apply the patterns and obtain the solutions. 

In addition, we will find it easier to read someone else's code. Creating generalizations can make everyone's job easier and, for this reason, understanding the code of other developers becomes easier. Increasing productivity and contributing to the organization and maintenance of projects.

*Example: if a class works correctly and has already been tested, we should avoid playing with it. To insert a new behavior, we must extend the class instead of modifying it.*


### Conclusion

Design Patterns are nothing more than general solutions to problems that arise throughout the development of software. In other words: they are elegant solutions, ready, tested and approved for common situations. They are very important in the training of a programmer, as they eliminate the need to keep on breaking your head and reinventing solutions all the time.
The use of these standards helps us to develop more quickly in the face of similar challenges. In addition to helping us organize the source code of the software we are developing.
